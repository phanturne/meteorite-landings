## Purpose 
The purpose of this visualization is to analyze 34,513 meteorite landings from the past 220 years and identify patterns in their occurrences. Meteorites are solid pieces of debris from objects that originate in outer space and have passed through the atmosphere. The data visualization display concentrations of meteorite landings over time.

Note: Only recordered meteorite landings are shown. Meteorite landing clusters that landed at the same location and at the same time have been filtered to appear as a single landing for performance and visibility.

## Functionality
This visualization allows for dragging and zooming of the globe, as well as filtering the year range of landings with a double ended slider.
